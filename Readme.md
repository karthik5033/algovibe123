## ⚙️ Our Approach
We implemented **Flood Fill** using both **BFS** and **DFS**, allowing pixel-by-pixel visualization of the fill process.

- Each cell represents a pixel in the grid.
- The algorithm dynamically fills connected regions in real time.
- Animation shows how the color “spreads” from the starting pixel outward — visualizing the frontier expansion of the algorithm.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **React + TypeScript** — component-based, reactive UI
- **Tailwind CSS** — responsive and modern styling
- **Canvas Grid Visualization** — animated updates per iteration
- **Algorithm:** BFS/DFS-based flood fill

---

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time color propagation animation  
- Adjustable speed control  
- Interactive grid for selecting starting pixel and color  
- Clear visualization of the algorithm frontier

## 🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates both the **logic** and **visual behavior** of the Flood Fill algorithm — bridging data structures with interactive visualization.  
It serves as both an educational and interactive experience for understanding BFS/DFS traversal.
